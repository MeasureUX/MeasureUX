My name is Shantanu Acharya. I am a Python Developer, my interests lie in Machine Learning and Backend Development. I am passionate for coding, love photography, like listening to EDM and pop music, a foodie, interested in latest technology trends, AI and gaming. I watch a lot of TV series, Anime and sci-fi movies. Die-hard fan of Batman and Star Wars.  

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science and Engineering** at *National Institute of Technology, Mizoram*.  

### Quotes I believe in:
- > "Work while they are sleeping. Learn while they are partying. Live like they are dreaming."
- > "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."  
\- *Elon Musk*
- > "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."  
\- *Steve Jobs*
