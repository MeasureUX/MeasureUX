## TensorNet

A high-level deep learning library built on top of PyTorch to solve computer vision problems.

- The library contains some advanced concepts like GradCAM and LR Finder into the package so that they can be used via a simple function call.
- Extensive use of code modularization and OOP has been done with proper docstrings for each function in order to maintain a clean and understandable codebase.
- _Tools_: Python, PyTorch.
- _PyPI URL_: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/torch-tensornet/)
- _GitHub URL_: [TensorNet](https://github.com/shan18/TensorNet)

## Topic Based Image Captioning

An automatic image caption generation system built using Deep Learning.

- Developed a novel image captioning model using CNNs and LSTMs.
- Created a system where LSTMs were given additional information (topics) extracted from image captions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- _Tools_: Python, Tensoflow-Keras, NLTK, OpenCV-Python, MSCOCO-2017 Dataset.
- _GitHub URL_: [Topic-Based-Image-Captioning](https://github.com/shan18/Topic-Based-Image-Captioning)

## Autoranking Amazon Reviews

Ranking the reviews on Amazon according to their helpfulness score.

- The problem was modeled as a regression problem. The performance was evaluated by using the coefficient of determination and rank correlation.
- Predictions were made based on various categories of features of the review text, and other metadata associated with the review, with the purpose of generating a rank for a given list of reviews.
- _Tools_: Python, Numpy, Pandas, textblob, scikit-learn
- _GitHub URL_: [Autoranking-Amazon-Reviews](https://github.com/shan18/Autoranking-Amazon-Reviews)
